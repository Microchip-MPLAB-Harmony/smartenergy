# PLC CRC Service

Some Smart Energy components, such as PLC stacks and the USI Service for seralization, use CRCs to protect frame integrity on communication media (PLC or Serial).
This library offers CRC calculation/verification as a unified service, allowing addition/modification of available CRCs in a single module, accessible by all consumers at the same time.
