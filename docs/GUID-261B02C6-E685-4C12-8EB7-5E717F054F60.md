# PLC PHY Driver

This driver provides a non-blocking interface with the external on-chip PLC transceiver. The library uses the SPI peripheral library (PLIB) and the Direct Memory Access controller to interface with PL360/PL460 PLC devices.

<b>Key Features:</b>
- Supports a single instance of the PLC device (PL360 / PL460) and a single client to the driver

- Supports the internal firmware upload process

- Supports interrupt handling to read PLC events

- Supports write/read to/from the internal PLC information Base (PIB)

- Supports transmitting and receiving PLC frames

- The library can be used in both Bare-Metal and RTOS environments
