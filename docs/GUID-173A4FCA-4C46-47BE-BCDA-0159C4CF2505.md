# How the Library Works

The PLC PHY driver library is a single-client, single-instance based driver interface.

<b>Abstraction Model</b>

The PLC PHY library communicates with a PLC transceiver using an SPI port, Direct Memory Access and the GPIO controller.  
The PLC transceiver performs PHY duties of the communication protocol, thus allowing a high latency attendance from the host MCU.

The PLC PHY library offers the necessary functions to control the transceiver, which include:
- Library initialization
- Transmitting and Receiving PLC frames
- Accessing PLC Information Base to get/set configuration parameters
- Enabling/Disabling transceiver Sleep Mode
- Check warnings due to Thermal Monitor control

The client can be:
- Application - Directly access the external PLC device (PL360/PL460) using the APIs provided by the PLC PHY Driver library

- G3 PAL layer - Application can run a PLC communication stack (G3/PRIME) by connecting it to the Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL) which can further be connected to the PLC PHY driver

<b>Working flow</b>

- The library's state machine is driven from the interrupt context. Once a transfer is complete a callback (if registered by the application) is given to the application from the interrupt context

- The library does not support queuing of more than one requests. The application must check and ensure that any previous request is completed before submitting a new one. This can be done by registering callback functions

**PLC Transceiver Interrupt mapping**

PLC transceiver events have to be notified to MCU in which PLC PHY Driver is running.  
This is done using a physical connection between the transceiver and an interrupt-capable PIO in MCU.  
The library implements [*DRV_PLC_PHY_ExternalInterruptHandler*](GUID-CAC25733-1D0F-44AE-84B4-82D140523B79.html) function, which is set as callback to be invoked when the interrupt is triggered on PIO.  
This function then reads information from the transceiver and performs the required operations.

**Driver Initialization and instance opening**

First of all, driver has to be initialized by calling [*DRV_PLC_PHY_Initialize*](GUID-3FE78AB9-5672-4748-BEEE-ADD364C8774A.html) to get a valid handle.  
Then, when an instance is opened by calling [*DRV_PLC_PHY_Open*](GUID-CC7037AE-6A1F-4EAF-894A-9588EEF3BEAD.html), the library loads a binary file onto the PLC transceiver. This is done using an internal transfer protocol through SPI port. After binary loading, the library manages the reset and startup of the transceiver. This task is transparent to the user, and the library is not available until binary file is transferred and thus PLC transceiver is ready to operate.  
At this point, driver is ready to be configured and used.
