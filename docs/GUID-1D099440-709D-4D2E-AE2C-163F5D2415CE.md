# DRV_G3_MACRT_SleepIndCallbackRegister Function

## C

```c
void DRV_G3_MACRT_SleepIndCallbackRegister (
    const DRV_HANDLE handle,
    const DRV_G3_MACRT_SLEEP_IND_CALLBACK callback
);
```

## Summary

Allows a client to set an sleep mode disable event handling function for the driver to call back when the PLC driver is active again.

## Description

This function allows a client to register a PLC sleep mode disable event handling function with the driver to call back when sleep mode is disabled and PLC driver has been restarted.   
The callback once set, persists until the client closes the driver or sets another callback (which could be a *NULL* pointer to indicate no callback).

## Precondition

[*DRV_G3_MACRT_Open*](GUID-CFC0A3D7-6B3D-4D47-A061-7314346BFFCF.html) must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| handle | A valid instance handle, returned from the driver [*DRV_G3_MACRT_Open*](GUID-CFC0A3D7-6B3D-4D47-A061-7314346BFFCF.html) routine |
| callback | Pointer to the callback function |

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
void APP_PLC_SleepModeDisableCb( void )
{
    // Sleep Disable handling here.
}

// myAppObj is an application specific state data object.
MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;

// Client registers a Sleep indication callback with driver. This is done once
// 'myHandle', returned from DRV_G3_MACRT_Open previously called
DRV_G3_MACRT_SleepDisableCallbackRegister( myAppObj.myHandle, APP_PLC_SleepModeDisableCb );

// Event is received when PLC device comes out of sleep mode and becomes active again.
```

## Remarks

None.
