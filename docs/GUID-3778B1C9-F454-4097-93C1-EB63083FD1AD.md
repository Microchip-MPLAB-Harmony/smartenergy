## Summary

PLC PHY Coupling data.

## Description

This structure contains all the data required to set the PLC PHY Coupling parameters, for a specific PRIME channel.

## Remarks

This type is only generated by MCC if the PLC Driver uses PRIME PHY.

Equalization coefficients and DACC table are not stored in the structure, just pointers to arrays were they are actually stored. This allows to use the same type for different PRIME channels.
