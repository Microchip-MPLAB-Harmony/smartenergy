# DRV_METROLOGY_UpdateCalibration Function

## C

```c
void DRV_METROLOGY_UpdateCalibration(void);
```

## Summary

Performs the internal calibration process.

## Description

Once the calibration process is started by calling DRV_METROLOGY_StartCalibration() routine, this funtion has to be called every integration period.

The metrology driver internally sets the duration of the calibration process as 4 integration periods.

CAL_M_Ix (X = A, B, C or N) and CAL_M_Vx (X = A, B or C) are used to calibrate the current and voltage
magnitudes of phase x. Calibration process is iterative, using prior or old magnitude calibration factors to perform the
next calibration cycle.

CAL_PH_Ix(x = A, B, C or N) and CAL_PH_Vx(x = A, B or C) are used to align the phase delays between each
pair of current and voltage channels, and also to optionally equalize the phase delays between voltage channels. All
phase shift coefficients used by the metrology library must be normalized to equivalent linear-phase shift amounts at
60Hz.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
    case APP_METROLOGY_STATE_CHECK_CALIBRATION:
    {
        /* Wait for the metrology semaphore to get measurements at the end of the integration period. */
        OSAL_SEM_Pend(&appMetrologySemID, OSAL_WAIT_FOREVER);
        
        DRV_METROLOGY_UpdateCalibration();
        
        if (DRV_METROLOGY_CalibrationIsCompleted())
        {
            bool result = DRV_METROLOGY_GetCalibrationResult();
            
            if (app_metrologyData.pCalibrationCallback)
            {
                app_metrologyData.pCalibrationCallback(result);
            }
            
            app_metrologyData.state = APP_METROLOGY_STATE_RUNNING;
        }
        
        vTaskDelay(10 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
        break;
    }
```

## Remarks

DRV_METROLOGY_CalibrationIsCompleted() routine should be called to detect if the calibration process is finished.
