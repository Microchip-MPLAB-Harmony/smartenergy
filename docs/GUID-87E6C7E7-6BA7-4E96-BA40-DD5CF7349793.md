## Summary

Identifies values needed to set different metrology configurations.

## Description

Field description:
- mc. Meter Constant (amount of energy signified by one output pulse). Units: pulses/kWh (active energy), pulses/kVARh (reactive energy), or pulses/kAmp2-h (amp square)
- freq. Mains frequency. Units: Hz.
- tr. 
  - In the case of a current transformer, this is the current transformer ratio
  - In the case of a Rogowski Coil, this is the current sensitivity (units: uV/A) at the main frequency specified in “Frequency” parameter.
- rl.
  - In the case of current transformer, this is the resistor load or burden resistor (units: Ω).
  - In the case of shunt resistor, this is the shunt resistor value (units: uΩ)
- ku. Voltage divider ratio.
- st. Sensor Type. Refer to DRV_METROLOGY_SENSOR_TYPE.
- gain. Programmable Gain Amplifier of the AFE (analog front end). Refer to DRV_METROLOGY_GAIN_TYPE.

## Remarks

None.
