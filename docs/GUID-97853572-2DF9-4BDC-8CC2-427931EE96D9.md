# Driver Libraries

**PLC** stands for Power Line Communications, a communication technology that enables sending data over existing AC or DC power cables.

The Smart Energy PLC Drivers are software components designed to act as interface between the Host MCU where it is running and a PLC transceiver (PL360 or PL460).

PL360 and PL460 devices operate in the Narrowband segment (3-500 KHz), running a binary file which implements low layers of Standard Protocols.
Available binaries are:

- G3-PLC PHY layer
- G3-PLC PHY + MAC Real Time layers
- PRIME PHY layer

**HW resources used by PLC Driver**

Each PLC Driver requires some HW resources in order to control the slave PLC Transceiver. These resources are:

- SPI Peripheral
- DMA Controller (XDMAC) or Peripheral DMA Controller (PDC)
- 4 GPIOs in case of PL360:
    - An interrupt-capable input GPIO to receive interrupts from PL360
    - An input GPIO to receive Carrier Detect signal from PL360
    - An output GPIO to drive the LDO Enable pin of PL360
    - An output GPIO to drive the NRST pin of PL360
- 5 GPIOs in case of PL460:
    - An interrupt-capable input GPIO to receive interrupts from PL460
    - An input GPIO to receive Thermal Monitor signal from PL460
    - An output GPIO to drive the TX Enable pin of PL460
    - An output GPIO to drive the LDO Enable pin of PL460
    - An output GPIO to drive the NRST pin of PL460
