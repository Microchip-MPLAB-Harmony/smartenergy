# DRV_G3_MACRT_GetTimerReference Function

## C

```c
uint32_t DRV_G3_MACRT_GetTimerReference (
    const DRV_HANDLE handle
);
```

## Summary

Gets the internal timer reference from PLC transceiver, in microseconds.

## Description

PLC transceiver has an internal 32 bits counter which is used as internal time reference for all time calculations in PHY layer.   
This counter is internally configured to be increased each microsecond.   
This function allows using this counter as an accurate time reference to upper layers.

## Precondition

[*DRV_G3_MACRT_Open*](GUID-CFC0A3D7-6B3D-4D47-A061-7314346BFFCF.html) must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| handle | A valid instance handle, returned from the driver [*DRV_G3_MACRT_Open*](GUID-CFC0A3D7-6B3D-4D47-A061-7314346BFFCF.html) routine |

## Returns

Internal timer reference from PLC transceiver in microseconds.

## Example

```c
// 'handle', returned from DRV_G3_MACRT_Open previously called

uint32_t macRtTimerRef;

macRtTimerRef = DRV_G3_MACRT_GetTimerReference(handle);
```

## Remarks

This function requires an SPI transaction to retrieve time from PLC transceiver, so potential jitter in different SPI accesses may impact accuracy.
