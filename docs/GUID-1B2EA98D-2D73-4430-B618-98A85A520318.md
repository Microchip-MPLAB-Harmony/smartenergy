## Summary

PLC PHY Coupling data.

## Description

This structure contains all the data required to set the PLC PHY Coupling parameters, for a specific transmission branch (associated to a G3-PLC PHY band).

## Remarks

This type is only generated by MCC if the PLC Driver uses G3-PLC PHY.

Equalization coefficients are not stored in the structure, just pointers to arrays were they are actually stored. This allows to use the same type for different G3-PLC PHY bands.
