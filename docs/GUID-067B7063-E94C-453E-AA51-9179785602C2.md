# DRV_METROLOGY_UpdateMeasurements Function

## C

```c
void DRV_METROLOGY_UpdateMeasurements(void);
```

## Summary

Updates the RMS values, metrology events and AFE energy value.

## Description

This function is used to obtain the RMS values and the metrology events from the control and accumulator registers of the metrology library.
AFE energy value is also calculated and updated.
Control and Accumulator registers are updated by the metrology library application once per an integration period.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
    case APP_METROLOGY_STATE_RUNNING:
    {
        /* Wait for the metrology semaphore to get measurements at the end of the integration period. */
        OSAL_SEM_Pend(&appMetrologySemID, OSAL_WAIT_FOREVER);
        
        DRV_METROLOGY_UpdateMeasurements();
    }
```

## Remarks

This routine should be called after every integration period interrupt captured by the IPC peripheral.
