# DRV_PLC_PHY_PIBGet Function

## C

```c
void DRV_PLC_PHY_PIBGet (
    const DRV_HANDLE handle,
    DRV_PLC_PHY_PIB_OBJ *pibObj
);
```

## Summary

Allows a client to get information from PLC transceiver about PHY information base (PIB).

## Description

This routine gets PHY data information from the PLC transceiver.

## Precondition

[*DRV_PLC_PHY_Open*](GUID-CC7037AE-6A1F-4EAF-894A-9588EEF3BEAD.html) must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.   
[*DRV_PLC_PHY_PIB_OBJ*](GUID-3BCCA565-F529-442A-BE9B-324CCA7F2702.html) must be configured before getting information.

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| handle | A valid instance handle, returned from the driver [*DRV_PLC_PHY_Open*](GUID-CC7037AE-6A1F-4EAF-894A-9588EEF3BEAD.html) routine |
| pibObj | Pointer to the PIB object to get |

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
// 'handle', returned from DRV_PLC_PHY_Open previously called

DRV_PLC_PHY_PIB_OBJ pibObj;
uint32_t phyVersion;

pibObj.pData = &phyVersion;
pibObj.length = 4;
pibObj.id = PLC_ID_VERSION_NUM;
pibObj.sync = true;

DRV_PLC_PHY_PIBGet(handle, &pibObj);

```

## Remarks

None.
