# PLC PHY Serial Service

This service allows controlling a PLC transceiver at PHY level through a Serial interface using USI Service.
This serialization includes transmission and reception of PLC frames, as well as getting and setting parameters in PHY layer Information Base PIBs.
On the other side of Serial interface, a Tool such as *Microchip Phy Tester Tool* or *Microchip PLC Python Libs* can be used to perform these operations.
