## Summary

Specifies the all reference values used for the auto calibration process.

## Description

Field description:
- aimVA. Rms voltage applied to the voltage input (phase A). Units: Volts.
- aimIA. Rms current applied to the current input (phase A). Units: Amps
- angleA. Angle between the voltage and current vectors (phase A). Units: Degrees. The value is positive if the
current is lagging the voltage.
- aimVB. Rms voltage applied to the voltage input (phase B). Units: Volts.
- aimIB. Rms current applied to the current input (phase B). Units: Amps
- angleB. Angle between the voltage and current vectors (phase B). Units: Degrees. The value is positive if the
current is lagging the voltage.
- aimVC. Rms voltage applied to the voltage input (phase C). Units: Volts.
- aimIC. Rms current applied to the current input (phase C). Units: Amps
- angleC. Angle between the voltage and current vectors (phase C). Units: Degrees. The value is positive if the
current is lagging the voltage.
- lineId. Line identifier of the phase to calibrate.

## Remarks

None.
