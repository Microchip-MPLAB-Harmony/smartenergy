# DRV_PLC_PHY_SleepDisableCallbackRegister Function

## C

```c
void DRV_PLC_PHY_SleepDisableCallbackRegister (
    const DRV_HANDLE handle,
    const DRV_PLC_PHY_SLEEP_IND_CALLBACK callback, 
    const uintptr_t context 
);
```

## Summary

Allows a client to set an sleep mode disable event handling function for the driver to call back when the PLC driver is active again.

## Description

This function allows a client to register a PLC sleep mode disable event handling function with the driver to call back when sleep mode is disabled and PLC driver has been restarted.   
The callback once set, persists until the client closes the driver or sets another callback (which could be a *NULL* pointer to indicate no callback).

## Precondition

[*DRV_PLC_PHY_Open*](GUID-CC7037AE-6A1F-4EAF-894A-9588EEF3BEAD.html) must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| handle | A valid instance handle, returned from the driver [*DRV_PLC_PHY_Open*](GUID-CC7037AE-6A1F-4EAF-894A-9588EEF3BEAD.html) routine |
| callback | Pointer to the callback function |
| context | The value of parameter will be passed back to the client unchanged, when the callback function is called |


## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
void APP_PLC_SleepModeDisableCb( uintptr_t context )
{
    // The context handle was set to an application specific
    // object. It is now retrievable easily in the event handler.
    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj = (MY_APP_OBJ *) context;

    // Sleep Disable handling here.

}
    
// myAppObj is an application specific state data object.
MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;

// myHandle is the handle returned from DRV_PLC_PHY_Open API.

// Client registers a data confirm callback with driver. This is done once

DRV_PLC_PHY_SleepDisableCallbackRegister( myHandle, APP_PLC_SleepModeDisableCb, (uintptr_t)&myAppObj );
```

## Remarks

None.
