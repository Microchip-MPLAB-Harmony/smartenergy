| DRV_G3_MACRT_TxCfmCallbackRegister | Allows a client to set a data confirm event handling function for the driver to call back when the requested transmission has finished |
| DRV_G3_MACRT_DataIndCallbackRegister | Allows a client to set a data indication event handling function for the driver to call back when a data reception has finished |
| DRV_G3_MACRT_RxParamsIndCallbackRegister | Allows a client to set a reception parameters event handling function for the driver to call back when a new data message is received |
| DRV_G3_MACRT_MacSnifferCallbackRegister | Allows enabling G3 MAC RT Sniffer capabilities and set the data buffer in which the content of the sniffer packet will be stored when a new PLC message is received |
| DRV_G3_MACRT_CommStatusCallbackRegister | Allows a client to set a Comm Status indication event handling function for the driver to call back when a Comm Status event has to be reported |
| DRV_G3_MACRT_PhySnifferCallbackRegister | Allows enabling G3 PHY Sniffer capabilities and set the data buffer in which the content of the sniffer packet will be stored when a new PLC message is received |
| DRV_G3_MACRT_ExceptionCallbackRegister | Allows a client to set an exception event handling function for the driver to call back when some error occurs through PLC transceiver communication |
| DRV_G3_MACRT_ExternalInterruptHandler | Allows application to register callback for PLC Interrupt pin |
| DRV_G3_MACRT_Status | Gets the current status of the PLC driver module |
| DRV_G3_MACRT_Tasks | Maintains the driver's state machine |
| DRV_G3_MACRT_SleepIndCallbackRegister | Allows a client to set an sleep mode disable event handling function for the driver to call back when the PLC driver is active again |
| DRV_G3_MACRT_Sleep | PLC driver Sleep mode management |
| DRV_G3_MACRT_EnableTX | Enables/Disables PLC transmission |
