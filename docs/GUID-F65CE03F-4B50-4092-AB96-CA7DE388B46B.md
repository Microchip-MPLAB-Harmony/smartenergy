## C

```c
typedef struct {
      /* Instant when frame transmission ended referred to 1us PHY counter */
      uint32_t time;
      /* RMS_CALC it allows to estimate tx power injected */
      uint32_t rmsCalc;
      /* Tx Result (see "TX Result values" above) */
      DRV_PLC_PHY_TX_RESULT result;
} DRV_PLC_PHY_TRANSMISSION_CFM_OBJ;
```

## Summary

G3 Result of a transmission.

## Description
