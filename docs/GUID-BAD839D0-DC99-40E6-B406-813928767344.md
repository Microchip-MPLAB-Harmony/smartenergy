# Configuring The Library

PLC PHY Coupling Service can be configured via MCC.

Alternatevely, the generated source/header files can be modified for custom configuration.

## Configuring via MCC

The following snapshots show the MCC configuration window for PLC PHY Coupling Service and brief description.

The configuration options will vary depending on the PLC protocol used by the PLC Driver (G3 or PRIME).

The configuration dynamic values (purple colour) will be updated, depending on ***PLC Driver Mode*** and ***PLC Coupling Settings*** in [PLC Driver MCC configuration](GUID-F3B4D4E5-0BE3-42AB-8080-D04E58F54789.html), in order to apply the configuration/calibration values for Evaluation Kits and/or reference designs.

### G3 Configuration Options

### PRIME Configuration Options

    - These values should not be modified by the user
  - **Channel "i":**
    - PLC PHY Coupling configuration for single channel "i"
    - Available only if ***Channel "i"*** is enabled in PLC PHY Driver MCC configuration
  - **Channels "i - j":**
    - PLC PHY Coupling configuration for double channel "i - j" (two consecutive channels)
    - Available only if ***Channels "i - j"*** is enabled in PLC PHY Driver MCC configuration

Each channel is configured inependentely. ***Common Configuration Options*** are available for each enabled channel.

    - 5: PL460 using Main Transmission Branch with a single external filter. When transmitting, both ASO pins are activated simultaneously
    - 7: PL460 using Main Transmission Branch with two external filters. When transmitting, ASO0 is activated for HIGH Tx mode, while ASO1 is activated for LOW/VLOW Tx modes
    - 8: PL460 using Auxiliary Transmission Branch

## Modifying Generated Source Code

PLC PHY Coupling Service generates the ***srv_pcoup.c*** and ***srv_pcoup.h*** files. In the header file there are definition macros with the values configured via MCC.

The user can modify these files instead of using MCC interface.

In the current version, this is the only method to customize Tx Equalization values (not supported in MCC configuration window for PLC PHY Coupling Service).
