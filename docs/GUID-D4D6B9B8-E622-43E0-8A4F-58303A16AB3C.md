# DRV_METROLOGY_SetConfiguration Function

## C

```c
void DRV_METROLOGY_SetConfiguration(DRV_METROLOGY_CONFIGURATION * config);
```

## Summary

Set metrology configuration. 

## Description

This routine is used to configure the metrology library according to the hardware in the input networks, as well as the programmable gain of the internal amplifiers.

This function has to be called before the DRV_METROLOGY_StartCalibration() routine, in order to ensure that the proper configuration has been applied before calibrating the system. 
If the programmable gain of the internal amplifiers changes, then the metrology library must be reinitialized in order to apply the changes.

The metrology driver code receives the parameters and writes the proper metrology control registers.

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| config | Pointer to configuration data to be used by the metrology library. |


## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
  DRV_METROLOGY_CONFIGURATION newConf;
  
  newConf.mc = 800;
  newConf.st = SENSOR_CT;
  newConf.freq = 50;
  newConf.gain = GAIN_1;
  newConf.tr = 1000;
  newConf.rl = 3.24;
  newConf.ku = 1651;
  
  DRV_METROLOGY_SetConfiguration(&newConf);
```

## Remarks

None.
