# PLC PHY Coupling Service

The PLC PHY Coupling service can be used in conjuction with a PLC Driver (PHY or G3 MAC RT) to facilitate the configuration of the PLC Transmission Coupling PHY parameters (PIBs).

If the application/middleware using the PLC Driver does not need to perform PLC transmissions, e.g. PHY sniffer, this service is not needed.
