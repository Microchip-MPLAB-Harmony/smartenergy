## Summary

Contains the data required to initialize the PLC driver.

## Description

This structure contains the objects needed to initialize the PLC driver.   
It is passed as parameter (casted as *SYS_MODULE_INIT*) to [*DRV_G3_MACRT_Initialize*](GUID-8D6705DB-D96A-4786-9724-F6B586F876B7.html) function.

Field description:
- plcHal. Pointer to [*DRV_PLC_HAL_INTERFACE Struct*](GUID-559A006E-859E-45E8-BB5A-70CE63853872.html) which defines the way driver accesses to PLC transceiver.
- plcProfile. Not used, reserved for future use.
- binStartAddress. Memory address where the first byte of transceiver's binary file is located.
- binEndAddress. Memory address where the last byte of transceiver's binary file is located.
- secure. Flag to indicate whether binary file is encrypted, not supported on current version.

## Remarks

None.
