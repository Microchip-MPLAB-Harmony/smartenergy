# APP_METROLOGY_StartCalibration Function

## C

```c
void APP_METROLOGY_StartCalibration(APP_METROLOGY_CALIBRATION * calibration);
```

## Summary

Starts internal calibration process. 

## Description

This routine is used to automatically calibrate the board. It requires accurate and stable voltage and current sources and loads, 
which can be provided by a meter test bench like the WECO (or equivalent equipment).

This routine must be called after a configuration routine (APP_METROLOGY_SetConfiguration), in order to ensure that the proper configuration has been
applied.

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| calibration | Pointer to calibration data to be used by the metrology library. |

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
  APP_METROLOGY_CALIBRATION newCal;
  
  /* Calibrate phase A, applying 220.00V, 5.000A, angle=60.00ยบ */
  newCal.aimVA = 220.00;
  newCal.aimIA = 5.000;
  newCal.angleA = 60.00;
  
  APP_METROLOGY_StartCalibration(&newCal);

```

## Remarks

None.
