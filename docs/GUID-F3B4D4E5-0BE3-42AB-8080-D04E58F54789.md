**NVIC Configurations**

- The PLC Phy driver has a strong dependency on a delay function defined in the HAL module. This delay function is called from the PIO Handler associated with the External Interrupt pin. 
- Applications designed in MCHP used as PLC examples use the Timer module as the delay interface, so the priority of the Timer interrupt must be higher that the rest of interrupts in order to ensure the correct operation.
