# Using The Library

The PLC PHY Coupling Service allows a PLC Driver's client to configure the PHY PIBs related to:

- PLC Transceiver used (PL360/PL460)
- Transmission hardware coupling design
- Transmission digital gain and equalization
- Calibration values for dynamic capabilities

If the application/middleware using the PLC Driver does not need to perform PLC transmissions, e.g. PHY sniffer, this service is not needed.

The API is sligthly different depending on the PLC protocol used by the PLC Driver (G3-PLC or PRIME).
