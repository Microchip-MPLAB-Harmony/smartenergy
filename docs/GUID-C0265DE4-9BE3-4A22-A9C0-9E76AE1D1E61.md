# DRV_METROLOGY_GetHarData Function

## C

```c
DRV_METROLOGY_HARMONICS * DRV_METROLOGY_GetHarData (void);
```

## Summary

Get the pointer to the harmonic analysis registers of the metrology library application running on the second processor. 

## Description

Harmonic analysis registers are acting as 32-bit metrology harmonic analysis registers.
The Metrology module shall generate the following primary output measurement quantities for each measurement interval, per-phase quantities with each phase designated by the subscript “_x” (where x = [A, B, or C] for voltage channels and x = [A, B, C] for current channels). 
Internal scaling allows accurate harmonic analysis for integration periods of up to 16 seconds for up to full-scale magnitude input waveforms.
For a detailed description of the harmonic analysis registers, refer to "drv_metrology_regs.h" header file.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

Pointer to the 32-bit metrology harmonic analysis registers.

## Example

```c
    /* Get Pointers to metrology data regions */
    app_metrologyData.pMetControl = DRV_METROLOGY_GetControl();
    app_metrologyData.pMetStatus = DRV_METROLOGY_GetStatus();
    app_metrologyData.pMetAccData = DRV_METROLOGY_GetAccData();
    app_metrologyData.pMetHarData = DRV_METROLOGY_GetHarData();
```

## Remarks

None.
